      "feasibility of coconut shell charcoal (CSC) and commercial activated carbon (CAC) for Cr(VI) removal is investigated in batch studies using synthetic electroplating wastewater. Both granular adsorbents are made up of coconut shell (Cocos nucifera L.), an agricultural waste from local coconut industries. Surface modifications of CSC and CAC with chitosan and/or oxidizing agents, such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively, are also conducted to improve removal performance. The results of their Cr removal performances are statistically compared. It is evident that adsorbents chemically modified with an oxidizing agent demonstrate better Cr(VI) removal capabilities than as-received adsorbents in terms of adsorption rate. Both CSC and CAC, which have been oxidized with nitric acid, have higher Cr adsorption capacities (CSC: 10.88, CAC: 15.47 mg g−1) than those oxidized with …\n",

To highlight their technical applicability, selected information on pH, dose required, initial metal concentration, adsorption capacity and the price of the adsorbents is presented.

The fungal biomass exhibited the highest dye uptake capacity at 35°C, at the initial pH value of 2.0 and at the initial dye concentration of 800 mg l−1. The Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the biosorption equilibrium and isotherm constants were evaluated at different temperatures. Equilibrium data fitted very well to the Freundlich model in the studied concentration (20–800 mg l−1) and temperature (25–55°C) ranges.

In this paper, a comparative review and critical analysis of the application of chemical extraction, bioleaching, electroreclamation, and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), in removing heavy metals from contaminated sludges is presented. Moreover, speciation studies, which can indicate ease of leachability of the different forms of heavy metals in sludge, are also presented. Experimental studies revealed a broad range in metal extraction efficiencies of the different extraction technologies. Acid treatment seemed to effectively remove Cd, attaining as much as 100% removal for some studies, as compared to bioleaching. SFE also gave higher removal efficiency than bioleaching.

To accomplish this, batch experiments in dead end mode were carried out using Chlorella algae to investigate the effect of feed concentration and transmembrane pressure (TMP) on cake resistance using cellulose ester and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. It was found that algae can cause significant fouling of both the cellulose ester and PVDF membranes. Fouling due to algae is quite complex because these cells release extracellular organic matter (EOM) which significantly increases the resistance.

      "อธิบาย  Contamination of groundwater due to toxic heavy metals, such as As and Hg, is of international concern. In this paper, the technical feasibility of some technologies to treat metalcontaminated groundwater is reviewed. All data presented are quoted from the original sources. It is conclusively evident from the literature survey that low cost technology, like adsorption, can demonstrate excellent metal removal capabilities comparable to reverse osmosis. Due to chemical modification, adsorption using inexpensive materials, such as coconut husk carbon, can remove As (III) with metal adsorption capacity of 159 mg/g. This high adsorption capacity suggests that adsorption treatment technique is capable of reducing a residual arsenic concentration to 10 µg/l, which is the maximum discharge limit set by the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). In spite of the availability of various technologies to treat metal-contaminated groundwater, the suitability of a selected technology for such a purpose depends on the initial metal concentration, the residual metal concentration required, the removal performance on heavy metal compared to other technologies, and the overall treatment cost.\n",
